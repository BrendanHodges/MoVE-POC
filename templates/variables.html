                Below are descriptions of county-level MoVE (Measurement of Voting Equity) variables available through the MoVE Data Extractor. 
                Each variable represents a specific component of voting access, election administration, or informational transparency at the county level. 
                The data is meticulously collected through direct communication with county election offices, public records, official documentation, 
                and publicly available sources to ensure accuracy and consistency.
            </p>

            <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
            <p style="line-height: 1.6;">
                Together, these county-level variables form the foundation of the MoVE Index score. 
                Each measure captures a distinct dimension of voting equity, and when combined, they provide a comprehensive assessment of how accessible and supportive a county’s election system is for its residents.
